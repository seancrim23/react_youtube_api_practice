# React Youtube API Practice
This is the same application as the one I wrote using vanilla Javascript. However, this application will be written using ReactJS.

# TO DO
- Click a button on the first page to authorize - DONE
- Successfully make search calls to the Youtube API using the auth response from the first step
- Add an input field and a button to submit dynamic search calls to the Youtube API
- Create a component to display the results in a list
- Create a component to display a singular result that was clicked on
- Create a component to add favorites to when "favorite" button is clicked
- Use Redux to handle actions
